## What is Fashionista?

Fashionista is a Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines list that I put together so when I reinstall the game every 6 months I don't have to redo my mod setup. It's here in case other people are like me. Its focus is a bit all over the place but it contains new content, better graphics, changes to the looks of the characters, changes to the UI, and a ton of bug fixes.

### Is this list suitable for a first time player?

Yes.  
For a first playthrough, I would suggest the unofficial patch profile. It is just bugfixes and graphic updates, the other profiles are harder and I would only suggest them for 2nd playthroughs.

### When is the list updated?

It's updated when someone tells me something is broken and I can fix it, I start another playthrough and look for new mods, or the Unofficial Patch updates.

Before you ask a question, please use the search functiond in Discord. There is a possiblity someone already asked the same or a similar question, and you may find what you are looking for in there.

If you want to ask for support in Discord, grab the "Fashionista" role in onboarding or in "Channels & Roles" at the top of the channel list.  
Please make sure to ask your question in the appropriate channel

## Preface

Some small notes about the list, the support, and troubleshooting:

1. As a modlist user, I expect some small efforts into fixing your own issues, mostly by searching the documentation provided here and by the Discord channels. It's very likely any issue you encounter has already been solved—if this is the case and it's well known, don't be surprised if you get ignored.
2. Support shouldn't be expected as instant—I have a full-time job on top of this, be nice.
3. Do not expect a 100% polished, well-balanced, and "perfect" experience. I am but one person, even if it's just a small list... and this is a famously buggy game.
4. We're modding an over 20-year-old game here, please temper your expectations some.
5. Suggestions are fine, but I have looked at every single mod on the Nexus for the list, so there is a decent chance I looked at it and said no, or there are issues with adding it due to compatability. But there is always a chance, or it might be a new mod —they still do come out from time to time, or something I missed.

## Hardware Requirements

|                 | CPU                                           | RAM                 | GPU                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| **What I have** | AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D 8-Core Processor 3.40 GHz | 32GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz | AMD Radeon RX 6950 |

It runs great with my system but it's probably fine on a potato.

### Storage Space

|                 | Total Space | Storage Type |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Minimum**     | 60GB        | SATA SSD     |
| **Recommended** | 80GB        | NVMe SSD     |

Your installation must be on an ***internal*** SSD or M.2 drive. External SSDs & HDDs are too slow for modlists to run from, and I suggest an M.2 drive, otherwise load and launch times are a bit longer than you would want.

## You Will Need

- A Nexus Premium account if you do not want to click install 100 times.
- Patience

## Pre-Installation

**This stuff needs to be done BEFORE starting the Wabbajack installation.**

### Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages

> [!CAUTION]
> MO2 needs this — don't skip it.
>
> [Download Visual C++ Redistributable Package.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

### Setup your Antivirus

Before you say "I don't have an antivirus" — you do, it's built into Windows. You need to **__exclude your Wabbajack folder, base game folder and your Fashionista installation folder__** from your antivirus' real-time protection as it will interfere with your install. It can and will interfere whilst you are playing too, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering.

> [!TIP]
> How do I do this, you ask? [Click here to find out how.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26)

If you use another antivirus program, refer to their steps for adding an exclusion.

***If you use Webroot, BitDefender, Norton or Kaspersky, I recommend you stop using these as these programs ***actively*** interfere with modlists even when they are excluded. Plus, you're wasting your money.***

### Install the game
Install the game either through Steam or GoG, both is fine.

> [!CAUTION]
> You don't need to run the game prior to installing the modlist.  
> In fact, the game will not start on modern systems. The unofficial patch will fix this.  
>
> **__DO NOT INSTALL THE UNOFFICIAL PATCH TO RUN THE GAME__**, Wabbajack will take care of that for you during modlist installation.

> [!WARNING]
> You **HAVE** to have to have a clean install of the game or the list will not work.

### Steam Specific Instructions

#### Disable Steam Overlay

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues, especially when using ENBs. Do so by heading into Steam, right-clicking on Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines in your game library and clicking **Properties** > **General** > **Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game"**.

<img src="img\GOG-Logo.png" alt="GOG Logo" width="200px">

### GOG Specific Instructions

#### What Version to install

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't use the GOG Galaxy version of the game, it adds the unofficial patch and could possibly cause issues.

You want the manual version without the patch
1. Sign into GOG and go to the Account page [Here](https://www.gog.com/en/account)
2. Us the Search bar to find the game I searched for ```Bloodlines``` then click on the game.
3. Then download the following 2 files
   - ```Vampire®: The Masquerade - Bloodlines™ (Part 1 of 2)``` 
   - ```Vampire®: The Masquerade - Bloodlines™ (Part 2 of 2)```
4. Read the Install Section and uses these files for the install.

## Installation

Installing the list has a couple of steps that you will have to follow for this to work.

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like `C:\Fashionista`. Do not install it to one of the protected folders such as `Program Files`, `Documents` or `Desktop`. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too — ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location.

>[!Caution]
> **__Make sure not to use any special characters in your folder name except for dashes (-).__** 
> Wabbajack can't handle characters like [ ] in folder names.

> [!TIP]
> **I recommend you keep your downloads outside of the Fashionista installation folder.**  
> If you ever need to reinstall the list, you won't have to download all the mods again.

## Post-Installation

After Wabbajack has given you the "installation successful" screen, you're free to close it.

### Launch the game

Start by opening the folder you installed the list into and then run MO2 by double-clicking `ModOrganizer.exe`.  
Select **Fashionista** in the drop-down if it's not already selected and launch the game.

![Fashionista launch](img/Launch.png)

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RUN LOOT.**
>
> The load order is exactly as intended out of the box and you do not need to change it.  

Plus it only works for Skyrim so double don't use it.  

### Creating a desktop shortcut

Open MO2, ensure **Launch** is selected in the dropdown and click the "Shortcut" button. From the small dropdown menu, click "Desktop".

## Alternative Profiles

The default Fashionista Profile is the one I would suggest but if you want to try the others there is more information on them here.

[Alternate Profiles Link](profiles.md)

## Updating Fashionista

When an update is released, please always check the [changelog](changelog.md) first. Backup your saves before you commit to any updates. Wabbajack doesn't usually touch save files, but it does have the ability to delete them if it wanted to.

If you have added anything to this modlist at all, Wabbajack will also delete those. You should know how to stop it from doing this if you're going to add stuff to modlists.

## Uninstalling Fashionista

Just delete the Fashionista folder and it'll be gone.

# Special Thanks 
Special Thanks to [Luca|EzioTheDeadPoet](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet) for the assistance with the list, without him there would be no list.

Special Thanks to iAmMascha for the assistance with the list, the readme would be much worse without their support.
