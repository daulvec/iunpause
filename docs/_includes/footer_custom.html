  <p>Special Thanks to iAmMe, Gallahorn, Schrubbls, Neochiken, ShifuYaku, Kaeltis, Decimal, Miss Corruption, Scrab and many others for their help encouragement and patience as I break things.</p>
  <p>Special Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet">Luca|EzioTheDeadPoet</a> for the assistance with the list, without him there would be no list.</p>
  <p>Special Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MaschaLV">iAmMascha</a> the readme would be much worse without their support.</p>
  <p>I don't have any Kofi or Patreon and will not get one, this is a hobby for me and I have no desire to monetize it and turn it into work.</p>
  <p>If you want to thank me for my work please donate to one of the other people on the server</p>
