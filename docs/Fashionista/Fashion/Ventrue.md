 The ruling class, the nobility, aristocracy, company CEOs, wealthy individuals, politicians – it's these people that make up the Ventrue clan. They ruled in life, and they rule in undeath as well. The Ventrue clan is the head of the Camarilla and members of this clan often become the "princes" or rulers of major cities. They move in the same high circles as the Toreador, but unlike the Toreador, Ventrue love to be in charge and they take on the burden of leadership stoically. The Camarilla as well as the Ventrue clan are hated with a passion by the Brujah and Gangrel clans, due to Ventrue desire to rule over all Kindred.
