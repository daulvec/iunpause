Malkavians are all clinically insane; the mental illnesses they suffer range from schizophrenia to near-catatonia. Strangely enough, they are a pillar of the Camarilla; historically they've been Kindred's seers and oracles, bound by strange insight and compulsions. This insight is reflected in the unique set of dialogue options (in a different font) for the Malkavians and encounters with NPCs that you'd never see with the other clans.
