## What is Fashionista?

Fashionista is a Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines list that I put together so when I reinstall the game every 6 months I don't have to redo my mod setup. It's here in case other people are like me. Its focus is a bit all over the place but it contains new content, better graphics, changes to the looks of the characters, changes to the UI, and a ton of bug fixes.

### Is this list suitable for a first time player?

Yes.  
For a first playthrough, I would suggest the unofficial patch profile. It is just bugfixes and graphic updates, the other profiles are harder and I would only suggest them for 2nd playthroughs.

### When is the list updated?

It's updated when someone tells me something is broken and I can fix it, I start another playthrough and look for new mods, or the Unofficial Patch updates.
