## What is Fashionista?

Fashionista is a Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines list that I put together so when I reinstall the game every 6 months I don't have to redo my mod setup. It's here in case other people are like me. Its focus is a bit all over the place but it contains new content, better graphics, changes to the looks of the characters, changes to the UI, and a ton of bug fixes.

### Is this list suitable for a first time player?

Yes.  
For a first playthrough, I would suggest the unofficial patch profile. It is just bugfixes and graphic updates, the other profiles are harder and I would only suggest them for 2nd playthroughs.

### When is the list updated?

It's updated when someone tells me something is broken and I can fix it, I start another playthrough and look for new mods, or the Unofficial Patch updates.

## Preface

Some small notes about the list, the support, and troubleshooting:

1. As a modlist user, I expect some small efforts into fixing your own issues, mostly by searching the documentation provided here and by the Discord channels. It's very likely any issue you encounter has already been solved—if this is the case and it's well known, don't be surprised if you get ignored.
2. Support shouldn't be expected as instant—I have a full-time job on top of this, be nice.
3. Do not expect a 100% polished, well-balanced, and "perfect" experience. I am but one person, even if it's just a small list... and this is a famously buggy game.
4. We're modding an over 20-year-old game here, please temper your expectations some.
5. Suggestions are fine, but I have looked at every single mod on the Nexus for the list, so there is a decent chance I looked at it and said no, or there are issues with adding it due to compatability. But there is always a chance, or it might be a new mod —they still do come out from time to time, or something I missed.

## Alternative Profiles

The default Fashionista Profile is the one I would suggest but if you want to try the others there is more information on them here.

[Alternate Profiles Link](profiles.md)

## Updating Fashionista

When an update is released, please always check the [changelog](changelog.md) first. Backup your saves before you commit to any updates. Wabbajack doesn't usually touch save files, but it does have the ability to delete them if it wanted to.

If you have added anything to this modlist at all, Wabbajack will also delete those. You should know how to stop it from doing this if you're going to add stuff to modlists.

## Uninstalling Fashionista

Just delete the Fashionista folder and it'll be gone.
