**This stuff needs to be done BEFORE starting the Wabbajack installation.**

### Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages

{: .caution}
> MO2 needs this — don't skip it.
>
> [Download Visual C++ Redistributable Package.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

### Setup your Antivirus

Before you say "I don't have an antivirus" — you do, it's built into Windows. You need to ****exclude your Wabbajack folder, base game folder and your Fashionista installation folder__** from your antivirus' real-time protection as it will interfere with your install. It can and will interfere whilst you are playing too, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering and in this lists case cause it to not function properly at all.

{: .tip}
> How do I do this, you ask? [Click here to find out how.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26)

If you use another antivirus program, refer to their steps for adding an exclusion.

***If you use Webroot, BitDefender, Norton or Kaspersky, I recommend you stop using these as these programs ***actively*** interfere with modlists even when they are excluded. Plus, you're wasting your money.***

### Install the game

Install the game either through Steam or GoG, both is fine.

{: .caution}
> You don't need to run the game prior to installing the modlist.  
> In fact, the game will not start on modern systems. The unofficial patch will fix this.  
>
> ****DO NOT INSTALL THE UNOFFICIAL PATCH TO RUN THE GAME****, Wabbajack will take care of that for you during modlist installation.

{: .warning}
> You **HAVE** to have to have a clean install of the game or the list will not work.

### Steam Specific Instructions

#### Disable Steam Overlay

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues, especially when using ENBs. Do so by heading into Steam, right-clicking on Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines in your game library and clicking **Properties** > **General** > **Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game"**.

![GOG Logo](img\GOG-Logo.png){: width="200"}

### GOG Specific Instructions

#### What Version to install

{: .caution}
> Don't use the GOG Galaxy version of the game, it adds the unofficial patch and could possibly cause issues.

You want the manual version without the patch

1. Sign into GOG and go to the [Account page](https://www.gog.com/en/account)
2. Use the Search bar to find the game (search for ```Bloodlines```) then click on the game.
3. Then download the following 2 files
   - ```Vampire®: The Masquerade - Bloodlines™ (Part 1 of 2)```
   - ```Vampire®: The Masquerade - Bloodlines™ (Part 2 of 2)```
4. Read the Install Section and uses these files for the install.
