The modlist includes several optional mods that you can enable or disable to customize your experience. Simply check or uncheck these mods in the left-hand panel of Mod Organizer 2.

## Accessibility Mods

The Malkavian fonts use some pretty wild and crazy looking fonts that can be hard for some people to read or even impossible.

I really like the effect but I've included this mod as an option for people who want to remove it.

Enable the following mod to set the font to the default font all the other clans use:

## ENB / Reshade

The ENB I've selected is a good general ENB, but I've added a couple extra options if you want to try something different.

To switch ENBs or ReShade, you need to disable the current one and enable the new one you want.

| Feature         | Keybind      | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ReShade Effects | Ctrl + F12   | Toggle all ReShade effects on/off    |
| ReShade Overlay | Ctrl + F11   | Toggle ReShade configuration overlay |
| ENB Effects     | Shift + F12  | Toggle all ENB effects on/off        |
| ENB Overlay     | Ctrl + Enter | Toggle ENB configuration overlay     |

## Malkavian Whispers

The default option is:

{: .mod}
>
> . **Uninterrupted background music**

This mod attempts to fix the background music not looping when you open menus.

The alternate option is:

{: .mod}
>
> . **Malkavian Whispers UPgraded**

This mod adds a chance to play Malkavian whispers on all maps in the game. This changes the same files as the Uninterrupted background music mod and should only be selected if you're playing a Malkavian, so it's disabled by default.

{: .thanks}
>The Upgraded version was made by [Svarttjern](https://www.nexusmods.com/vampirebloodlines/mods/369) and I would like to thank them for it.

## UI Themes

This is a group of UI overhauls based on specific clans. They're a nice touch if you're playing one of the clans, so I do suggest them.
