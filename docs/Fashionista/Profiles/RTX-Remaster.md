# {{ page.title }}

**RTX Remaster** is an asset-by-asset remaster of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. Fully remodeled, retextured, and re-lit using Nvidia's RTX Remix tools.

{: .warning}
> **New Game Required** - You must start a new game when switching to this profile. Do not use save files from other profiles or mod versions.

More information about RTX Remaster can be found on [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-rtx-remaster).

This mod is in progress and is more of a tech demo at this point.

## Requirements

RTX Cards 2080, 3080, and 4080 have all been tested.
I cannot confirm if any of this works on AMD cards currently.

I know it's a joke at this point, but make sure you have semi-recent or up-to-date Nvidia drivers.

I have tried the mod on my AMD 6950 and it works but it runs slow enough that play is impossible so there is **NO** Support for the profile.

## Required Info about the Profile

Once you're in-game, you should see a small bar at the top telling you that you can press Alt+X at any time to open the Remix panel.

Once you're in, press Alt+X to open the remix panel. You can do lots of stuff, like break the mod and have to re-copy the files! Or, you could also enable and disable raytracing to compare things.

## Known Issues

- Some bottles seem to only appear remastered sometimes
- Water still broken
- Light culling still broken
- Characters/skinned meshes still not remasterable
- Some prop issues (street lamps off the edge of the sidewalk, for example)
- Skybox visible in world if you look up (I've submitted a bug for this - it's new)
- Normal triangulation issues on some assets
