**Companion Mod Core Edition** lets you recruit other NPCs to join and travel with you throughout the game. You can also take the role of your own companions, using their own abilities and disciplines. Or you can make them go to your haven and "pose" those who aren't traveling with you where you want. Finally, there is the possibility to embrace a ghoul of your choice.

Originally the mod (made ages ago by Dheu on top of UP 5.6) also featured other features, but when I restored the mod for the latest UP, I had to remove them:

- **New items** - Two items and their instructions (the game had already reached the max limit for items which the new patch had already filled).
- **Enslaving companions** - The whole concept of enslaving companions against their will to make them follow you (and the related custom dialogs).
- **Hamsters easter egg** - Too cringy for my tastes.

Still, the restored mod works and I hope you'll have fun playing with it :)
