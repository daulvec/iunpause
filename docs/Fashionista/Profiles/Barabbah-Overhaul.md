## Extra Add-on's

I have includeded two additional mods to cover the extra features that you can setup in the mod that you can enable or disable as you want.

{: .mod}
> - **Barabbah_Addon - Arsenal Mod** This enables some of the weapons of the old but cool mod - this does make the game more difficult
