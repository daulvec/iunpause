Clan Quest Mod (CQM) is a fan-created add-on for the classic PC title “Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines”. Originally Clan Quest offered seven new quests, each one specific to each of the seven clans. Since the first version, even more new content has been added to the mod, including an additional path midway through the game, allowing you to join forces with the Sabbat and battle it out with the other Kindred of LA.
