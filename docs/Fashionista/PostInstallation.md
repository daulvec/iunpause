## Mod Organzier 2

The list is built using Mod Organizer 2 and we use this to run the list and pick your options and profiles.

Start by opening the folder you installed the list into and then run MO2 by double-clicking `ModOrganizer.exe`.  

{: .text-center }

This should open Mod Organizer 2

Plus it only works for Skyrim so double don't use it.
