After Wabbajack has given you the "installation successful" screen, you're free to close it.

### Launch the game

Start by opening the folder you installed the list into and then run MO2 by double-clicking `ModOrganizer.exe`.  
Select **Fashionista** in the drop-down if it's not already selected and launch the game.

> **DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RUN LOOT.**

> The load order is exactly as intended out of the box and you do not need to change it.  

Plus it only works for Skyrim so double don't use it.  

### Creating a desktop shortcut

Open MO2, ensure **Launch** is selected in the dropdown and click the "Shortcut" button. From the small dropdown menu, click "Desktop".
