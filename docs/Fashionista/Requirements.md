This list has some specific requirements to set it up.

## Hardware Requirements

|                 | CPU                                           | RAM                 | GPU                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| **What I have** | AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D 8-Core Processor 3.40 GHz | 32GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz | AMD Radeon RX 6950 |

It runs great with my system but it's probably fine on a potato.

### Storage Space

|                 | Total Space | Storage Type |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Minimum**     | 60GB        | SATA SSD     |
| **Recommended** | 80GB        | NVMe SSD     |

Your installation must be on an ***internal*** SSD or M.2 drive. External SSDs & HDDs are too slow for modlists to run from, and I suggest an M.2 drive, otherwise load and launch times are a bit longer than you would want.

## You Will Need

- A Nexus Premium account if you do not want to click install 100 times.
- Patience
