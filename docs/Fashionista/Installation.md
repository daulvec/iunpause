Installing the list has a couple of steps that you will have to follow for this to work.

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like `C:\Fashionista`. Do not install it to one of the protected folders such as `Program Files`, `Documents` or `Desktop`. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too — ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location.

>[!Caution]
> ****Make sure not to use any special characters in your folder name except for dashes (-).****
> Wabbajack can't handle characters like [ ] in folder names.

> [!TIP]
> **I recommend you keep your downloads outside of the Fashionista installation folder.**  
> If you ever need to reinstall the list, you won't have to download all the mods again.

## Post-Installation

After Wabbajack has given you the "installation successful" screen, you're free to close it.
