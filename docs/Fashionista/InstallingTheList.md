~~The list can use either Steam or GOG version of Vampire the Masquarade: Bloodlines~~

{: .important}
>At this time the list **ONLY** Supports Steam, I want to bring back GOG support as I like them and its the only option for some people to purchase or install the game.

{: .caution}
>You don't need to run the game prior to installing the modlist.
>
>In fact, the game will not start on modern systems. The unofficial patch will fix this this is normal and expected.
>
>**DO NOT INSTALL THE UNOFFICIAL PATCH TO RUN THE GAME**, Wabbajack will take care of that for you during modlist installation.

{: .warning}
>You HAVE to have to have a clean install of the game or the list will not work.

## Steam Specific Instructions

### Disable Steam Overlay

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues, especially when using ENBs. Do so by heading into Steam, right-clicking on Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines in your game library and clicking Properties > General > Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game".

## Installation

Its finally time to install the list!

Open Wabbajack and and click Get Started

{: .text-center }
![Getting Started](/media/img/Installation-Get-Started.png)

The list is not featured so you will have to check Non-Featured and I would suggest setting the game to 
``Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines``

{: .text-center }
![Getting Started](/media/img/Wabbajack-Filters.png)

Then you will want to select the ``Fashionista`` list.

When you click on the list you should open a new page where it will ask you to ``Download & Install``

{: .text-center }
![Download and Install](/media/img/Download-Install.png)

Click the  ``Download and Install`` button and it will start downloading, this might take a while depending on the speed of your internet connection simply wait for it to finish and then it should auto open to a new screen.

{: .text-center }
![Instalation Locations](/media/img/Locations.png)

To the Left of the Splash Screen you will see to Locations

- **Installation Location**
  - This is the location where your list will be installed 

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like ``C:\Fashionista.`` Do not install it to one of the protected folders such as ``Program Files, Documents or Desktop``. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too — ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location.

{: .caution}
>Make sure not to use any special characters in your folder name except for dashes ``-`` 
>Wabbajack can't handle characters like ``[ ]`` in folder names.

- **Downloads Location**
  - This is the Location where all the mod and archives will be downloaded to. 

{: .tip}
>I recommend you keep your downloads outside of the Fashionista installation folder.
>If you ever need to reinstall the list, you won't have to download all the mods again.
