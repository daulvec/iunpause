## Beta 1 for 2.0

https://mega.nz/file/N4lCyApa#EhzakeSPgsQ1c4wlRpzNtpqbGrlCoJ7DG5Ly46hfVsA

It's a work in progress as I had to rebuild most of the list.

Support is limited and I will be gone most of the weekend with only phone access and most of the mods here know nothing about modding this game, support can and will be slow.

**Things to know:**
- This is a Stock Game setup and supports Steam ONLY sorry to the GOG owners for now.
- This will probably change at release but it's the easiest way for me to test stuff as I'm working on it.
- There are a TON of ModDB outfits like 60+ of them and you will have to click through all of them. This is going to be a thing with the list going forward and it's only going to get worse. I'm not sorry.
- Tons of outfits are missing and there they might not work on all profiles.
- Profiles are the main focus of this release as to fix the issues with them I had to rewrite the MO2 plug
- Profiles now have a bloodlines.ini file that stores the name of the argument/folder name for the install, the Mod name that contains the cfg files and the Mod name that contains the saves that should be created so the saves and ini editing in MO2 should work properly now and be per profile.
- Profile name Mod names and layout and mods are all in flux and this is NOT going to be a save safe install I would really only suggest installing this if:
  - You want to try out the new version and see how it's working
  - If you want to play one of the Alt profiles Camarilla edition, HD Overhaul, Barabbah's Addon or the Companion Mod.
- There are a ton of new outfits and a ton of missing outfits, I am taking this time to update all the outfits and making sure they all function properly, some are probably broken and I am also taking the time to find out what slots they cover 0-3 and you can find that in the Notes of the mod.
- Full release is going to have a bunch of new profiles added and the missing Clans and outfits added but this will also require a bunch of new ModDB mods...
- I left save games in some of the profiles on purpose Don't use them I was using them for testing stuff.
- In my testing the profile issues with alternate profiles is resolved but you HAVE to use the exe with the same name as the profile, I am looking into making this easier but this is the easiest and best solution for now.
- This is not on the UI you need to download the file from mega and install it through Wabbajack manually, if this is too hard then wait for the full release as I am not supporting installing it.

Feedback would be amazing as this has been a couple weeks of work and a lot of testing.

### Fixes/Changes
1. Started Creating Custom Menu's for the various Profiles only have the Main one so far, I do not have an ultrawide monitor so I can not test it on that.
2. Changed Rootbuilder a bit.
3. A number of bug fixes.

There have been a couple of reports of the game crashing when loading large areas, I am in the middle of a playthrough for fun as well as testing and have not run into the issue so far so I can not verrify it. Reloading the game has fixed the issue for some people and for others they disabled a number of the HD textures under Graphics Updates and that fixed the issue.

Its possible that I have too many HD textures setup and thats causing issues but its also possible that this is an issue with lower spec computers. If anyone has more information or a save with the issue please let me know in the support channel in discord.

### Fashionista v1.0.12

Change to Rootbuilder to prevent launch issues for some people.

- Camarilla Edition Reborn

Big Changes and there might be breaking changes here this is NOT save safe. 
Every Profile has been rebuilt.
The main profile now uses the Plus Patch Version and the Companion mod has been removed from it.
A ton of new outfits and more coming.
I am now requiring mods from the ModDB, you are going to need to manually download them as part of the install.
I am now includding the Camarilla Edition Reborn overhaul its a new profile and includes the Plus version.
More new profiles on the way to add additional overhaul support.
RTX mod will hopefully come soonish as I think??? I might have figured out the issue with it but holding off for now till I can confirm its working properly.
