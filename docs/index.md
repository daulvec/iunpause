# iunPause's Mod lists

A website for support of all my Wabbajack Mod Lists.

## Fashionista

Fashionista is a Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines list that I put together so when I reinstall the game every 6 months I don't have to redo my mod setup. It's here in case other people are like me. Its focus is a bit all over the place but it contains new content, better graphics, changes to the looks of the characters, changes to the UI, and a ton of bug fixes.

## Trash Panda Valley

A Stardew Valley list based around Goth Emo and Alt-Subculture.
